# chat resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

A chat is a collection of [chatMessages](chatmessage.md) between one or more participants. Participants can be users or apps.

> **Note**: If the chat is associated with an [onlineMeeting](../resources/onlinemeeting.md) instance, then some of the listed methods will transitively impact the meeting.
